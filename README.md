This is an implementation of a trade bot designed for low-latency environments like cryto exchanges. It leverages on robust market algorithms and statistical models to take high-frequency trades. The bot takes care of various market factors both in highly volatile and side ways moving markets. The advanced market-making strategies and risk-management protocols are designed to secure sustained growth and minimize market mishaps. The bot is written from scratch in ```Rust```. The bot is being primarily developed for ```KuCoin``` exchange but hope to deliver for other exchanges too.

Sniper is still in its early stages of development, and the code is subject to change. The bot is designed to be memory-safe, concurrent, and asynchronous, making it suitable for high-performance trading applications.

API_KEY="Your_API_key"
SECRET_KEY="Your_secret_key"
PASSPHRASE="Your_passphrase"
```

- Ensure you have Rust installed. If not, install it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)
